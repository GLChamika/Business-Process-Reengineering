## Selecting the business processes
 
Panilkanda Tea involves mainly on operational process, financial process, human resources managing, consumer relations, marketing, importing resources, export and logistics. The following information is given on three selected processes.

- Operational Process
- Inventory managing process
- Human Resource management process


## Operational Process

Panilkanda Tea operates their production processes in the same manner as other local tea companies do. So, the first thing they do is collecting fresh tea leaves. Panilkanda Tea Factory currently collects tea leaves from 19 villages around Deniyaya such as Urubokka and Koppakanda using their lorries and staff. The tea leaves brought to the factory are placed in large drying containers in the warehouse and they undergo a withering process, which provides hot air to reduce the moisture content of the tea leaves by about 40%. Then the withered tea leaves are mixed with a chemical compound during the rolling method and directed to the oxidization process. Finally, the semi-finished tea which is subjected to the above process, is dried again and sorted into tea particles through a sieve and filtered through various nets. This helps to classify tea into different grades. Then the final tea product will be labeled and marketed as Panilkanda Tea after evaluated by the tea maker and expert tasters to ensure that it meets all quality standards in terms of appearance, aroma, color, and character.


## Inventory managing process

The amount of tea leaves obtained daily from the farmers is stored in the factory for two days. The storekeeper then records the amount of leaves received and the amount sent to production and notifies the inventory manager through  an inventory report at the end of the day.
      Since the Panilkanda tea factory  mainly targets for export, the final product is not stored in large amounts. However, they have managed to keep about 1% of the final product in the factory.

 
## Human Resource management process

The company currently has a staff of around 100. There is a Board of Supervisors consisting of 20 members to supervise the staff. Also, the Board of Supervisors are responsible for the top management of their field. All the staff members are paid salaries and wages based on their job category and the time period they work. Overtime payments and other benefits are also in operation for them. All the staff members and managers of the Panilkanda factory are insured and they also maintain an employee fund for use in case of any other emergency.



# Currently available methods for improve the processes

The Panilkanda Tea Factory has made a significant contribution to the tea export industry in Sri Lanka since 1999. Although the company seems to have a clear vision, we have seen some steps that can be taken to improve further the efficiency of company's activities. We intend to provide the following information as some solutions to our client, Mr. Pasan Horawalawithana.

Some of the work currently in operation at this factory is done by hand. For that reason, the work is slow and costs more. According to our proposed concepts, our idea was to install a CCTV system in the trucks and to replace the system with electronic billing machines to prevent fraudulent transportation and loading of tea leaves into trucks and to provide free or subsidized fertilizer to tea growers.

In addition, the Tea Controller will be able to obtain a notification from the Tea Manager through the proposed system and obtain a monthly and annual bulk report to obtain detailed and accurate information on how stocks have been collected for stock control and how those stocks have been directed to production. We also proposed to maintain a database for record relevant report details.

We also proposed to maintain a new database for employee management in the organization, to activate a fund for employee welfare, and to install fingerprint machines for top managers as well as lower level employees to record their attendance.


## Operational Process

The existing operational process of “Panilkanda Tea factory” is mostly handled manually.  Having to recite the stock to each truck assistant consumes time and there’s a good chance of mispronunciation and miscommunication. Sometimes truck assistant might forget to create the invoice and there can be some mistakes when doing the calculations manually. And it will take some time to write them in hand and do the calculations. There’s a evidence to show previous receipts or receipts written by drivers and there’s a chance to change written data also. 

Hence electronic bill machine is suggested. Because of that they will not get any chance to cheat. To implement solution, truck assistant should have a knowledge to use electronic bill machine. So truck assistant can easily enter data into the electronic bill machine and get the receipt on the same time. There’s no need to do calculations manually because of electronic bill machine.  Only the mistake can be happen is entering wrong data accidently.  There’s no chance to change data or show previous bills because in bill it displays the dates. After creating the bill truck assistant send the bill and receive the payment. 
 

### Feasibility of the re-engineered operational process

 
- Budget              - Cost of providing electronic bill machines for each truck assistant
- Maintenance         -  Costs for maintaining electronic billing machines
- Development Cost    - Cost of  developing bill machine software and the training cost of assistants
- Infrastructure      - It is sufficient to have an electronic billing machine for each assistant



## Inventory Management Process

The existing inventory keeping process of “Panilkanda Tea factory” is again mostly handled by manually. Stock keeper does the inventory by hand and enter inventory data into inventory log book. In this way, the stock keeper has to do everything by hand since its using non digital media to store information. In the as-is process there may be delays when updating the logs of tea stocks. And also a lot of errors can be happened in the process. Like misplacing the stock details, and forget to enter data.
 
Instead of using inventory log book, here we suggested database to store data. This system keeps track of all the inventory and the stock keeper can update database daily based on the stocks received and sent.  One of the most important things about this system is that it can forecast daily amount of tea received and sent and shows the monthly progress also. This system does not need any special devices to run on. Any regular device or a computer can run this program. So considering costs, there’s no cost in implementing this solution into “Panilkanda Tea Factory”. With the inventory being digitalized, the following reports can be generated.

- Inventory reports
- Monthly report  

The owner can use this to minimize the loss he’s getting from the business.


### Feasibility of the re-engineered inventory managing process

- Budget                       - Cost for implementing the inventory management system             
- Maintenance              -  Maintenance cost for maintaining servers and supporting inventory system
- Development Cost   -  The cost of developing an inventory management system may change over time and the cost to install the system may change according to the system progresses.                   
- Infrastructure             -  A personal computer with internet connection is sufficient


## Human Resource Management Process

In existing Human Resource Management process of “Panilkanda Tea Factory” they mark the attendance of workers using attendance sheet. It is also a manual process. Then they engage in their duties which was assigned to them. If they have any issues they inform that to the relevant supervisor. Supervisor check whether it is a technical or health issue and inspect that. They give remedies for those issues. Then after workers return to their duties. There can be mistakes happen when taking their attendance manually and time consuming.
 
Rather than that here we suggested finger print machine to keep track of their attendance. This is more efficient. This will store the arriving time and leaving time. No one can cheat. Here attendance details are stored in the database. So they can easily calculate the number of days they work, worked hours etc.   Here Panilkanda Tea factory needs a finger print machine.
 
Here are the best software options which “Panilkanda tea factory” can use in order to manage their stocks, operations and human resources. This will help digitally and electronically accept payments, track available inventory, manage workers, and confirm or approve stocks. These solutions are implemented by retail, tea factories alike. With a specific solution, tea factory employees can better manage sales transactions, leverage payment processing technology, ensure the infrastructure of workers, and generate insights on store performance, margin opportunities, and customer loyalty.

 
### Feasibility of the re-engineered HR management process
 
- Budget                    - Cost of installing few fingerprint machines and implementing a system
- Maintenance           -  Cost of maintaining fingerprint machines and the system.
- Development Cost  -  Improving or updating fingerprint machines and system servers can incur some significant costs.
- Infrastructure          -  A personal computer with internet connection and few fingerprint machines



# Justifications to the proposed methods


They use a manual system to verify inventory management, operational processes, and human recourses management process. As a result, our approach is to create a system that can store and retrieve inventory information, electronic billing machine to give invoices and take finger print to mark their attendance.
In the inventory process, they manually called enter data into log book  and checked inventory. As a result, we suggest the addition of a database for all processes. As a result, the device would be able to provide information quickly.
 
In human resource management process, existing system use an attendance sheet to mark the attendance of employees. Here we proposed finger print machine to take their attendance. So they can reduce paper cost and it is more accurate. 
In operational process, they are using manually invoice giving system. We suggested electronic bill machine for that. It is more accurate and efficient. As a result, our system allows you to gather stock information, operational processes and human resources.



# How to implement the solutions?

At the Panilkanda Tea Factory, the owner must first identify the basic steps to be taken to re-engineer the business processes that we have selected. They should then consider the order in which they are to be implemented, the resources required and the cost. In terms of feasibility, they have to choose the tools they want from the tools we have suggested. It should then be considered whether the implementation of the above solutions is done by the owner himself or by outsourcing equipment. They can then proceed with the implementation process.



# How the proposed change will interact with other processes in the organization

The solutions we proposed have a positive effect on the selected processes as well as other business processes operating within the business. For example, reengineering the Inventory Management process allows them to improve their accuracy and efficiency through database. Automation of those processes helps to complete other tasks smoothly. So that the overall operation of the business as a whole will be efficient and smooth.
